### BlockBuilders AI API Usage Guide
## What is it?
A guide for how to use the APIs of our Blockbuilder AI. With a bunch of getting started scripts to give you a headstart for playing with it yourself.
## How does it work? 
There are six different APIs that take a prompt as an input and then are trained in a particular Minecraft specialism.
- Builder API - Builds a Minecraft model from a prompt using Shap-e on Replicate.
- Understand API - Understands the intention of the player based on a prompt. 
- Command API - Returns a Bedrock command based on a prompt.
- Build command API - Returns specific variables for editing the Minecraft model.
- Syntax API - Returns the correct Bedrock block, entity or item syntax from a prompt.
- Target API - Returns Bedrock target selectors and arguments from a prompt.
